= ADR-011 - Support Simple Diagram Definitions by Reusing Sirius Desktop VSMs

== Context

We want to support the definition of Sirius Web modelers directly in the web interface.
At first we will only consider diagrams definitions.

For this, we need the equivalent of Sirius Desktop's VSMs to describe the structure, look & feel of the diagrams.
The Sirius Desktop VSM is very complex, and has quite a lot of legacy conceptual issues.
Its implementation is also not designed to be easily reused outside of an Eclipse Platform context (particularly the "edit support" which depend on the Eclipse UI).
Ideally, we would like to have a completely new, non-EMF based set of POJOs to describe only a well-defined subset of the VSM model.

However, after trying this approach it appears that the current Sirius Components code base still has quite a few dependencies on EMF, which are complex to remove.
These would be needed to support the edition of non-EMF based "documents" representing diagram configurations.

== Decision

For the first version of "metamodeling support", we will reuse the existing Sirius VSM models and allow their edition directly in the Sirius Web UI.
We will only support their visualisation and edition through the model explorer and the accompanying properties view.
No graphical or even form-based representation will be provided for them.

Only a subset of the VSM features will be actually supported, but in a first version we will use the default properties views rules.
This means we will display all the properties of all the elements, even those which are not actually supported.
If this causes too many issues we may programmatically define a custom `IPropertiesDescriptionRegistryConfigurer` to restrict which configuration attributes are displayed to the studio author.

== Status

Accepted.

== Consequences

The Sirius VSM metamodels are quite complex and use some EMF features which are not present in the sample metamodels we use (_Flow_ and _BPMN_).
They will probably reveal bugs and limitations that will need to be addressed to make their visualization and edition possible.

The reuse of these metamodels is a temporary stopgap and we still want to offer a better approach to configure diagram in the future, which does not inherit from all the "bagage" of the Sirius Desktop VSMs.
This means we must start a separate effort to allow for the platform to support documents which are not based on EMF, so that we are not blocked again by this technical limitation.
