= ADR-012 - Add support for resizing diagram elements.

== Context

We now have the ability to move a diagram element in Sirius but it is still not possible to resize an element. In Sprotty, the move feature was available and except some adjustments to meet our needs, the main part of the work was the creation of the GraphQL API and handling this move event in the backend.
Currently, sprotty does not offer the resize feature.


== Decision

We have to implement the resize feature in the frontend and the backend.


=== Frontend

When selecting an element, in addition to the displayed border, handles should appear in each corner and each border. That means eight handles to make it possible to resize an element in the four cardinal directions and the four intercardinal directions.

==== Expected behavior and feedback

When resizing a container, every contained element should keep the same absolute location. Indeed, if the user resizes the container toward the North-West direction, the container position is also changed. If contained elements keep the same relative position, every one of them, and their connected edges will move.
In addition, if the user tries to reduce the size of a container, we should not have a child out of the parent bounds. The frontend feedback should keep a minimal size to keep all children within the container bounds.


==== Technical choices

There is two ways to display handles at element selection:

* By creating new children elements in the sprotty model. They will have their counterpart view to display them as SVG.
* By modifying the node view SVG to display handles as rectangles in the same SVG figure.

We will privilege the second solution since handles are pure feedback in the same way the selection border is. We do not want to represent them as node children.

We will extend the Sprotty `MoveMouseListener` to detect that the drag and drop is performed on a handle. That is possible by retrieving the DOM element target id. Each handle will have a unique ID to detect in which direction the resize is performed. 
If a resize is detected by the listener, a `ResizeAction` will be created instead of a `MoveAction`. The new `ResizeCommand` will update the sprotty model to display the resize feedback.

=== Backend

The new position and size of the moved element will be sent the backend through a new GraphQL API:
```
    type Mutation {
        updateNodeBounds(input: UpdateNodeBoundsInput!): UpdateNodeBoundsPayload!
    }
    UpdateNodeBoundsInput {
        representationId: ID!,
        diagramElementId: ID!,
        newPositionX: Float!,
        newPositionY: Float!,
        newWidth: Float!,
        newHeight: Float!,
        projectId: ID!,
    }
```

The information will be passed to the `NodePositionProvider` and `NodeSizeProvider` in the same way as the move API but through a new `ResizeEvent` containing the position delta and the new size. The `IDiagramContext` API will be modified to replace the `MoveEvent` by a common interface `ÃŒDiagramElementEvent`:
```
    IDiagramElementEvent getDiagramElementEvent();

    void seDiagramElementEvent(IDiagramElementEvent diagramElementEvent);

    Position getStartingPosition();

    void setStartingPosition(Position startingPosition);
```
The backend will also have the responsibility to make sure that no children are out of the new container bounds even if the frontend also checks this constraint. Indeed, another event from another client may have occurred in the meantime. In that case, the data provided by the frontend may not be relevant anymore.

== Status

Proposed

== Consequences

The resize can lead to overlap, in the same way as the move action. The overlap will be handled in the exact same way than for the move: overlapped elements will be slightly moved to avoid them.
